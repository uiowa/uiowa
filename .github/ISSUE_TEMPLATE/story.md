# Story

As a _____<!-- "role" - Who is this feature for? --> I want ____<!-- "action or feature" - What does the user want to be able to do? --> so that ____<!-- "value or goal" - Why does the user want this feature? -->

<!--
Ideally a story meets these criteria:

Independent - Story is sufficiently self-contained that it can be prioritized by something other than technical dependency.
Negotiable - There is room for collaboration around what the feature is and how it works.
Valuable - The story adds some increment of visible value for users.
Estimable - The team can estimate how big the story is compared to other stories in the backlog.
Small - Can the story be completed in a single sprint? If not, can it be split into additional stories?
Testable - There is a way to know when we are done with the story.

It's okay if the story doesn't perfectly reflect all of these qualities right away. Sometimes just getting the story down is enough to get started. The story may need to be changed as additional information comes to light.
