# Configuration Splits
There are a few prerequisites that you should read and understand before 
working with config splits.

## Config Ignore
### Weight: 100
This split should be used for configuration that editors, webmasters, etc. can
change in production. Think of it as a config split with database storage. The
high weight means config entities in this split will take precedence on import.

## Site Split
### Weight: 90
Site splits are not created by default. A multisite can create one and it should
be named the same as the multisite machine name. Check the multisite's blt.yml
file in the multisite directory for the machine name. BLT will activate the 
split, if it exists. 

Site splits should be stored in the `../config/` directory relative from
the docroot. The config directory should contain the split directory named as
the multisite URI. This is created automatically during provisioning.

## Caveats
**DO NOT** export the same configuration with different values to multiple 
splits, even config ignore.

**DO NOT** split core.extension for your site. This will only lead to problems.
You can blacklist individual modules that your site needs and Config Split will
enable them.

**DO NOT** share theme-dependent configuration in the sync directory if your
site split has blacklisted a custom theme. The shared configuration will be 
deleted on export which will break BLT's configuration integrity checks. An 
example of this would be a block.
