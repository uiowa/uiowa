# Configuration Splits
There are a few prerequisites that you should read and understand before 
working with config splits.

## Config Ignore
### Weight: 100
This split should be used for configuration that editors, webmasters, etc. can
change in production. Think of it as a config split with database storage. The
high weight means config entities in this split will take precedence on import.

Configuration that is ignored cannot be selectively enabled/disabled in 
environment splits. Use Drupal's [configuration override system](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/configuration-api/configuration-override-system) if you need to override configuration per environment.

## Site Split
### Weight: 90
Site split directories are created when a site is provisioned. However, the 
Config Split configuration is not created by default. A multisite can create
one and it should be named the same as the multisite URI host. BLT will activate
the split, if it exists. 

Site splits are stored in the `../config/` directory relative from
the docroot. 

To register a configuration split for a multisite, create the split locally in
the UI and export to the site split directory.
```
drush config-split:export mysitesplit
```

Deploy the code changes to each environment per the normal process and import 
the configuration from the split manually.
```drush @mysite.dev config:import --source ../config/www.mysite.uiowa.edu --partial```

## Caveats
**DO NOT** export the same configuration with different values to multiple 
splits.

**DO NOT** split core.extension for your site. This will only lead to problems.
You can blacklist individual modules that your site needs and Config Split will
enable them.

**DO NOT** share theme-dependent configuration in the sync directory if your
site split has blacklisted a custom theme. The shared configuration will be 
deleted on export which will break BLT's configuration integrity checks. An 
example of this would be a block.
