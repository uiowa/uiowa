# Coronavirus Split

The reason that the webmaster and editor roles are split, even though they are the same as the default is because the Coronavirus site also uses the `sitenow_v2` split, which has different permissions defined. The order that they are loaded is:
1. Default
2. Sitenow V2
3. Coronavirus site split
