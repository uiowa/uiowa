## Introduction
The University of Iowa Alerts module provides a block to display Hawk Alerts published through the University of Iowa emergency alert system.

Every 30 seconds, the module checks the alert feed provided by https://emergency.uiowa.edu/ and updates the block content using jQuery.

## Installation and configuration

Enable the module as usual.

Configure the feed source and optionally provide a message to display when there are no active alerts at admin/config/user-interface/uiowa-alerts.
