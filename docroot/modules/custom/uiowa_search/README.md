## FAQs

### What is the tag manager code?

This module adds a Google Tag Manager code to the site that is managed at the University level. This allows for tracking traffic across all sites using this module. It is meant to handle the situation where a site did not install Google Analytics and needs information about their site, however it may also be used to gather data about how traffic flows across the University web sites.

The Google Analytics within the Google Tag Manager container should not impact any site specific Google Analytics code if properly implemented.
