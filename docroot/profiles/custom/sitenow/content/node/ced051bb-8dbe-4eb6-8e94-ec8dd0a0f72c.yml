      value: "<p>Building a website can be a daunting process whether you're new to working on the web or a seasoned expert. This guide can help you get started using the SiteNow service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Navigating SiteNow</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When logged in to your SiteNow site as a webmaster, you'll see two different menus appear on the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Administrative menu</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Located at the top of the page (or as a left-hand sidebar, if desired), this menu houses the settings and configuration options for your site. Here's a brief summary of what you'll find on each page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Content: </strong>Find and add content, content moderation tools, and uploaded file management<br />\r\n<strong>Structure:&nbsp;</strong>Navigation menu settings, content tagging, and webforms<br />\r\n<strong>Appearance:&nbsp;</strong>Design theme settings (No actions available to webmasters)<br />\r\n<strong>Configuration: </strong>Site-wide settings,&nbsp;content type settings, Google Analytics configuration, URL redirects function<br />\r\n<strong>People:</strong>&nbsp;Add users and edit roles/permissions<br />\r\n<strong>Find text: </strong>Identify pages with specific words or phrases in content</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Page menu</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The menu beneath the gold brand bar on each page is used to make edits to the current page, not the site as a whole. Functions include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>View:</strong> Preview the page as it will appear to site visitors<br />\r\n<strong>Edit:</strong>&nbsp;Adjust settings for the page (SEO, navigation menu location, etc.)<br />\r\n<strong>Layout:&nbsp;</strong>Open the Layout Builder drag-and-drop web editing interface, add and edit on-page content<br />\r\n<strong>Revisions:&nbsp;</strong>Revert page to previous saved version (stores 10 most recent saves)<br />\r\n<strong>Usage:</strong>&nbsp;Track and view recent edits to page<br />\r\n<strong>Replicate:&nbsp;</strong>Create exact copy of page and current formatting<br />\r\n<strong>Delete:&nbsp;</strong>Remove page permanently from site</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Using the Layout tool</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Clicking the \"Layout\" option in the Page menu will bring up the on-page content editing interface. Users have access to a broad array of design options that make it simpler to create an engaging, effective web site.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Adding content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can add content to the page you're currently editing using the following on-page buttons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Add section</strong><br />\r\nCreate a new horizontal area on the page that will contain vertical columns to which content can be added. You will be prompted to select the number of columns. You will also have the option to adjust the background color, width, and spacing settings for horizontal section.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Add component</strong><br />\r\nChoose from a list of available content components to add content to the page. The list of components ranges widely in purpose and design options. For example, the \"Text area\" component helps users add copy to the page using a WYSIWYG editing tool. The \"Banner\" component allows the addition of an image or video to the page with header text and button links in the foreground. You can browse our <a href=\"https://sitenow.uiowa.edu/documentation/layout-builder\">descriptions of each component type</a> or experiment to find the one that suits your needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Editing content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply hover your mouse over the area you'd like to edit to make the option visible. For sections, click the \"Configure section\" link that appears in the section's top left corner. For components, a circular icon with a gray pencil in the center will appear on mouse hover. Click the icon and then the \"Configure\" link to bring up the editing options for the component you're editing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions, please&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sitenow.uiowa.edu/contact-us\">contact us</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to learn more about using SiteNow? <a href=\"https://webcommunity.sites.uiowa.edu/training/using-layout-builder\">Watch our training session</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
